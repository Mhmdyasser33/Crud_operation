A CRUD operation project using Redux Toolkit involves creating a web application with the ability to Create
Read, Update, and Delete data. Redux Toolkit simplifies the process of creating a Redux store and handling 
asynchronous actions. Implementing Create, Update, and Delete functionality involves defining actions that
modify the state by adding, updating, or deleting items from a list. Components can interact with the store
using useDispatch and useSelector hooks.
